## 1. What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. It's known for its:
- Robustness
- Extensibility
- SQL standards compliance
- Ability to handle complex queries
- Support for large-scale applications

## 2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?
A schema in PostgreSQL is a namespace that contains named database objects (tables, views, indexes, functions). 

**Key Benefits:**
- Logical organization of database objects
- Multiple user support without interference
- Security control at schema level
- Prevention of naming conflicts

## 3. Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL.
### Primary Key
A column or group of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Foreign Key
A column that creates a link between data in two tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

## 4. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?
### VARCHAR(n)
- Variable-length character string
- Maximum length of n characters
- Stores only actual data length plus 1 byte
- Efficient storage for variable-length strings

### CHAR(n)
- Fixed-length character string
- Padded with spaces to length n
- Always uses full allocated space
- Best for fixed-length data

## 5. Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.
Used to filter rows based on specified conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 50000 AND department = 'IT';
```

## 6. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?
### LIMIT
- Specifies maximum number of rows to return
- Useful for pagination

### OFFSET
- Skips specified number of rows before returning results
- Often used with LIMIT

```sql
SELECT * FROM products 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20; -- Returns rows 21-30
```

## 7. How can you perform data modification using UPDATE statements?
Used to modify existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE employees 
SET salary = salary * 1.1 
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

## 8. What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?
Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

### Types of JOINs:
```sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT orders.*, customers.name 
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT customers.*, orders.order_date 
FROM customers 
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

## 9. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.
Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;
```

## 10. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG in PostgreSQL?
Common aggregate functions include COUNT, SUM, and AVG.

```sql
-- Multiple aggregations
SELECT department, 
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
    SUM(salary) as total_salary,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

## 11. What is the purpose of an index in PostgreSQL, and how does it optimize query performance
Database structures that improve data retrieval speed.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_email 
ON employees(email);
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster data retrieval
- Improved query performance
- Uniqueness enforcement
- Better sorting operations

## 12. Explain the concept of a PostgreSQL view and how it differs from a table.
A stored query that acts as a virtual table.

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE last_order_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
```

**Key Differences from Tables:**
- No physical data storage
- Auto-updates with base tables
- Simplifies complex queries
- Additional security layer
